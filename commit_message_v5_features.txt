rust/mqtt0: add MQTT 5.0 features - $SYS events, shared subscriptions, topic alias

The mqtt0 broker needed additional MQTT 5.0 features to better support production use cases including load balancing and monitoring capabilities.

- Add $SYS client events for connect/disconnect notifications
  - Publishes to $SYS/brokers/{node}/clients/{clientid}/connected
  - Publishes to $SYS/brokers/{node}/clients/{clientid}/disconnected
  - JSON format compatible with EMQX for easy integration
  - Configurable via BrokerConfig.sys_events() and node_id()

- Implement shared subscriptions ($share/group/topic)
  - Parse $share/{group}/{topic} subscription format
  - Round-robin message distribution among group subscribers
  - Works with both MQTT v4 and v5 clients
  - Proper cleanup on client disconnect

- Add Topic Alias support (MQTT 5.0)
  - Maintain per-client alias -> topic mapping
  - Handle alias with topic (update mapping) and alias without topic (lookup)
  - Reduces bandwidth for repeated publishes to same topic

- Add helper functions for topic matching with MQTT wildcards (+, #)
- Add comprehensive test cases for all new features
